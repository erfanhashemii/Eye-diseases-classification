Diabetes is a condition that carries an increased risk of developing eye complications. Diabetic eye disease includes complications such as diabetic retinopathy, cataracts and glaucoma.

Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults. People with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are at risk. Itâ€™s possible to be unaware that you have severe diabetic eye disease and suddenly go blind. Fortunately, most cases of blindness can be prevented with regular eye examinations and proper care.
